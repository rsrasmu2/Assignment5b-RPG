This is my Roleplaying Game for SER316's assignment 5b.

Here is a link to my screencast: https://youtu.be/9ZCndclGnhk

I used three design patterns in my program. I used the Observer pattern to notify my player when they level up, increasing health and stats. I used the Builder pattern to create my races, classes, and monsters. I also used the Factory pattern in tandem with the Builder pattern to create monsters specific to each floor.
